============================================================

Here are the most relevant projects/experiences:

1.  **Project: Extending VGGT for Novel View Synthesis:** This directly aligns with "evaluating and optimizing AI algorithms to produce high-end visualization content" and "rendering/image processing techniques."
2.  **Work: Working Student Data Scientist at CHECK24:** Your work on object-level coherence tracking, liveness detection, and evaluating SOTA models directly applies to producing test data and optimizing AI algorithms for visual content.
3.  **Work: Junior Software Engineer - NLP at P&M Agentur (with GPT 4.0):** Experience with Generative Augmented Retrieval (GAR) and GPT 4.0 is highly relevant to "AI tools" and "Stable Diffusion is a plus," showcasing experience with generative AI.

**What to emphasize in application:**
*   Practical experience in Novel View Synthesis, rendering, and image processing techniques.
*   Evaluating/optimizing AI models and preparing visual data, including computer vision aspects.
*   Proficiency in C++ and Python, coupled with hands-on experience with modern generative AI tools like GPT-4.
