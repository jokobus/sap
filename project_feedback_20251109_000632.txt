*   **Why it's relevant to this job:** This demonstrates foundational knowledge and practical experience across various machine learning paradigms. It shows a structured understanding of AI, which is crucial for any AI Developer role. Specifically, "MNIST Digit Recognition" touches on basic image processing with ML, and "Reinforcement Learning" or "Recommender Systems" could be relevant for interactive or personalized experiences in 3D applications. It directly showcases "experience in AI tools" and general understanding of AI concepts.
*   **Specific skills/technologies that match job requirements:**
    *   **AI/ML Concepts:** Comprehensive understanding of various ML algorithms (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning).

### 3. Projects that are Less Relevant

While demonstrating other valuable skills, these projects are less directly aligned with the core AI Developer role focused on visualization, rendering, and specific AI/ML algorithm development as outlined in the job description:

*   **COVID-19 user tracker:** Primarily web application development, not AI/ML focused.
*   **Grad School Application:** Another web application development project, not AI/ML focused.
*   **Path_planning on BlueROV:** Focuses on traditional algorithms (A-star) and robotics, less on modern AI/ML for visualization. While relevant for C++ skills, the primary AI component is missing.
*   **Stock Analyser:** Financial modeling and data analysis, not directly AI/ML for visualization.
*   **Gesture Controlled drone:** Robotics and control systems. Unless the gesture recognition heavily involved deep learning for vision, its relevance to "AI Developer" for visualization is indirect. Good for demonstrating hardware interaction, but not the core AI requirement.
*   **Xbot - An autonomous flying robot:** Robotics, embedded systems (Arduino, C/C++), PID control. Excellent for C/C++ skills, but not explicitly AI/ML for "high-end visualization content."

*Self-correction note:* While some of these projects showcase C++ skills, which is a requirement, their *primary focus* is not on AI/ML or visualization, making them less relevant *in the top tier* compared to the others. It's still worth mentioning C++ proficiency based on these projects, just not as core AI examples.
